            <h2><a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Main_Page" target="_blank">Bulbapedia</a></h2>
            <p>
                Bulbapedia is an encyclopedia about Pokémon to which anyone can contribute. 
                Since its launch in February 2005, it has grown to become one of the largest Pokémon resources on the internet.
                As part of Bulbagarden, this ever-growing wiki is supported by the Bulbagarden Archives, the Bulbagarden forums and the Bulbagarden Discord.
                An amazing resource for anyone who is either new to Pokemon, or wish to learn more about the games. 
            </p>
            <h2><a href="https://pokemondb.net/" target="_blank">Pokemon Database</a></h2>
            <p>
                <blockquote>"We believe in making Pokémon information as clear and easy to digest as possible."</blockquote> 
                Another great resource, and my personal favorite place to find information on specific Pokemon.
                They have a pokedex entry for every pokemon, which makes it easy to look up a moveset or stats of both your own Pokemon and your opponents.

            <h2><a href="https://calc.pokemonshowdown.com/" target="_blank">Damage Calculator</a></h2>
            <p>
                One of the main goals of a Nuzlocke is to complete the game without wiping to opponents in battle. At times, you may find yourself in a situation
                where you don't know if a move is going to K.O. and it could turn the tide of the battle. This is where the Damage Calculator excels. You are able to input every
                bit of information about your Pokemon and the opponents, and smartly make decisions based off the calculations.
