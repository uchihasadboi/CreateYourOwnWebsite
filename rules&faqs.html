        <h2>Rules</h2>
        <p class="text">
            There are many ways to complete a Nuzlocke challenge, but below are the rules that must be followed to
            consider it one.
        </p>
        <div class="list">
            <ul>
                <li><iconify-icon icon="mdi:pokeball" class="pokeball"></iconify-icon>&nbsp;&nbsp;You may only catch the
                    first Pokemon
                    you encounter on each route</li>
                <li><iconify-icon icon="mdi:pokeball" class="pokeball"></iconify-icon>&nbsp;&nbsp;If any of your Pokemon
                    faint, you must
                    consider them "dead" and either release them, or place them in the PC. They cannot be used again.
                </li>
                <li><iconify-icon icon="mdi:pokeball" class="pokeball"></iconify-icon>&nbsp;&nbsp;You must nickname all
                    of the Pokemon
                    you catch.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <p class="text">
            In addition to the previous rules, many people have found that adding further stipulations can increase the
            difficulty.
            The first three rules below are typically referred to as "Hardcore" mode. These rules are optional, but can
            elevate the
            experience and are recommended for people that are looking for a challenge.
            The following two rules are stipulations that most people add to their casual and hardcore Nuzlockes so they
            have more diverse options, and can use shiny Pokemon if they happen to be so lucky.
        </p>
        <div class="list">
            <ul>
                <li><iconify-icon icon="mdi:pokeball" class="pokeball"></iconify-icon>&nbsp;&nbsp;No items in battle,
                    except for held items and Pokeballs for wild encounters.&nbsp;&nbsp;<i

                <li><iconify-icon icon="mdi:pokeball" class="pokeball"></iconify-icon>&nbsp;&nbsp;None of your Pokemon
                    can be a higher level than the gym leaders highest level Pokemon. No over-leveling!&nbsp;&nbsp;<i
                        class="hardcore">*Hardcore*</i></li>
                <li><iconify-icon icon="mdi:pokeball" class="pokeball"></iconify-icon>&nbsp;&nbsp;If you completely
                    white out to a trainer, you must start over your run.&nbsp;&nbsp;<i class="hardcore">*Hardcore*</i>
                </li>
                <li>&nbsp;</li>
                <li><iconify-icon icon="mdi:pokeball" class="pokeball"></iconify-icon>&nbsp;&nbsp;If you encounter a
                    Pokemon from an evolutionary line that you have already caught, then you can re-roll your encounter.
                    This is commonly known as the duplicate clause.
                </li>
                <li><iconify-icon icon="mdi:pokeball" class="pokeball"></iconify-icon>&nbsp;&nbsp;If you encounter a
                    shiny Pokemon, you can catch it and replace it with the non-shiny version you already own.
                    If you do not own that shiny, you can catch it and hope you find the matching encounter later in the
                    game. This is referred to as the shiny clause</li>
            </ul>

        <p class="text">
            The most important thing to consider when you are attempting a Nuzlocke is that none of these rules actual
            matter!
            This is meant to be a fun way to play a nostalgic childrens game that adds a level of risk, while being
            rewarding when you find yourself out of a tough spot.
            If you are not having fun with your current rule set, change it. You're not cheating if you're the one
            making the rules!

            What is the purpose of a Nuzlocke?
        </p>
        <div class="list">
            <ul>
                <li><iconify-icon icon="mdi:pokeball" class="pokeball"></iconify-icon>&nbsp;&nbsp;There really isn't
                    one. These are self imposed rules which are intended to increase the difficulty of Pokemon games,
                    while making it much more strategic.
                    While doing a Nuzlocke you have to understand when and how to use moves effectively, when to swap
                    your Pokemon out when they're in danger of dying, how to use held items efficiently, how to team
                    build, and how to maintain momentum in battles.
                    You need a fair amount of knowledge about Pokemon, such as: their types/strengths/weaknesses, their
                    movesets, when they evolve/if they evolve, their abilities, their stats, and most important, how
                    well they fit in your current team.

                            Tools</a></u> page can be a great starting point for anyone interested in attempting their
                    first Nuzlocke!

                <li><iconify-icon icon="mdi:pokeball" class="pokeball"></iconify-icon>&nbsp;&nbsp;The goal of a Nuzlocke
                    is to defeat all 8 Gym Leaders(or 16 if you're in Johto), and then defeat the Elite Four and
                    Champion.
                    This can be done as you like, but you must at least follow the first three rules posted above for it
                    to be considered a "true" Nuzlocke

                <li><iconify-icon icon="mdi:pokeball" class="pokeball"></iconify-icon>&nbsp;&nbsp;The creator of the
                    original Nuzlocke created a webcomic back in 2010 showcasing the new rules he had implemented into
                    his challenge run of Pokemon Ruby
                    and posted it on 4chan, where it was discovered and adopted by many people on the site. The original
                    webcomic had a Nuzleaf that was a reference to John Locke, who is a character in the TV show Lost
                    known for doing things in a hard way,
                    and thus the Nuz-Locke was born. The ruleset found its way to the internet and the rest is gaming
                    history.

            What happens if you are doing a hardcore run and your Pokemon over-level during a Gym Leader battle?

            <ul>
                <li><iconify-icon icon="mdi:pokeball" class="pokeball"></iconify-icon>&nbsp;&nbsp;The general rule of
                    thumb across the community is that the level cap stops as soon as you start the battle with a Gym
                    Leader.
                    A lot of people will actually train all of their Pokemon up until they are about to level up over
                    the level cap, thus giving them a level advantage as soon as they can KO an opponent Pokemon.

            What Pokemon game would be best for a beginner Nuzlocker?

        <div class="list">
            <ul>
                <li><iconify-icon icon="mdi:pokeball" class="pokeball"></iconify-icon>&nbsp;&nbsp;This has been a topic
                    of great discussion, but the community believes the easiest game to Nuzlocke would be FireRed or
                    LeafGreen.
                    These games are based on the original two games, Red and Blue, but with updated Generation Three
                    mechanics. The gameplay is somewhat slower paced than future generations, and allows a great
                    introduction to managing
                    your Pokemon effectively, while soaking up all that nostalgic charm of the First Generation.

            What happens if all the Pokemon you have over-level before you reach the next Gym Leader? Are you allowed to

        <div class="list">
            <ul>
                <li><iconify-icon icon="mdi:pokeball" class="pokeball"></iconify-icon>&nbsp;&nbsp;Good luck on your next
                    run! Jokes aside, this would actually be a restart as you are out of usable Pokemon. As I stated
                    before, at the end of the day, these runs
                    are meant to be fun. So, play however you wish!

            Does it matter if I play in switch mode versus set mode?
        </p>
        <div class="list">
            <ul>
                <li><iconify-icon icon="mdi:pokeball" class="pokeball"></iconify-icon>&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a great
                    question. The difference between Switch and Set is essentially the difference between easy and hard.
                    Switch Mode allows you to be aware of the next Pokemon your opponent is going to send out, and gives
                    you an opportunity to switch out your current Pokemon for one that has a better matchup. This
                    somewhat trivializes
                    the purpose of a Nuzlocke, as you can almost always have a solution to what could otherwise be a
                    problem. Playing in Set Mode forces you to play intelligently and make defensive decisions, knowing
                    that whatever Pokemon you might want to send
                    in is going to take damage from your opponents Pokemon. Although I did not state this rule earlier,
                    it does play an important part in the makeup of a Nuzlocke. Set Mode is the preferred rulestyle, but
                    again, you can play however you wish!

            I don't like grinding for levels on my Pokemon, is it okay to cheat in Rare Candies?

                    Absolutely, this is actualy highly encouraged. The whole point of a Nuzlocke is to have fun and test yourself, not to sit there and mindlessly press the A button for 45 minutes. If you are playing on
                    a *Completely Legit, Totally Not an Emulator, Nintendo DS*, you can find Gameshark Codes online that can assist you in this.
